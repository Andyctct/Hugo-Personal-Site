Actual Published Date: TBD 

Disclaimer: As per the description, this is going to be an extremely short and barebones guide towards setting up a site of this (low) caliber. I'm essentially just going to document the steps I took to put this website out.

- Step 1: The very first thing I did was do some research the different ways of building a website which include hardcoding, using a    static site generator and then deploying, or using a CMS. This is a good article covering the basics of what a static site is and what popular SSG options are, https://theunlikelydeveloper.com/build-a-static-website/. I chose to use a static site generator because I had never worked with one before and I thought it would be a good learning experience (and I didn't want to do too much work directly with html / css). My next goal and another option I would recommend for any beginners reading this is looking into building a website with react / vue, this is based off recommendations from friends as well as online public opinion. 

- Step 2: After deciding that I wanted to work with an SSG and picking Hugo, I moved on to learning the basics of Hugo. For learning Hugo, I believe [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3) is the best introductory hugo playlist by far as it even shows up in the gohugo documentation many, many times. 

- Step 2.5: Along with learning the fundamentals of Hugo, I think it is very useful to learn / refresh yourself on the basics of markdown / html again. With this being my first time really working with markdown, I had to learn it from scratch but found it really quite simple and I think taking the time to read through [this](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) article will be more than enough to get you through the basics of working with markdown.

- Step 3: Honestly, step 2 was the bulk of this short learning journey and I moved on to picking a theme from <https://themes.gohugo.io/>. From here, I encourage you to read, read, and read more documentation. If the problem you're looking for isn't solved by reading the official documentation, then try looking elsewhere on the web, you're probably studying computer science so you should be used to this by now. Next, I will list out some of the solutions I found to problems that I ran into and think might be somewhat common for beginners, and other links that I think will be useful at this stage.

-Step 4: Deploying the website, an unexpectedly hard step probably because I am rusty working with git.
