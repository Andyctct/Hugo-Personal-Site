I think everybody has these moments where you reflect on some aspect of your life and realize it doesnt match up with what your ideals were in the past, e.g., your younger ideals of being rich in the future or successful by whatever metric you want. And instead of feeling remorse I think people often say / think something along the lines of "My experiences in my life since that point has changed my goals / ideals and now I realize that my current situation is what I truly wanted (perhaps before unbeknownst to me), or at least is something that I am extremely content with". Basically people seem to not harbour many negative feelings towards not reaching past goals, but instead think that their goals and ideals have changed rather than failed to have been met. I believe a lot of the time its unclear whether this is caused by some sort of coping technique to resolve cognitive dissonance and avoid feeling regret, or if its truly the persons goals changing.

revisionist history

As we live our lives, we naturally grow as people as a result of our everchanging environments and new experiences. Yet at the same time
we find ourselves dealing with more and more serious decisions in our life, as well as the age-old struggle of finding ourselves. If we look beyond our lives, everything around us also often feels uncertain and it sometimes seems like the world itself is so uncertain. So how are we supposed to find an internal sense of certainty amidst the tumultuousness of our lives and the world? There are also a plethora of related questions we should explore such as is uncertainty in our lives necessarily a bad thing? Is uncertainty a natural part of life?

. . .

In my experience and conversations with people, it seems like this wasn't really a issue that occurred to us as kids. Obviously, the fact that we had less serious decisions plays a role, but what else could it suggest?  Our identities as kids are also lower-dimensional, so there is less internal complexity to us. Perhaps it means that as we become more complex people and see more of the world we realize there are more possibilities and perspectives than we initially thought, an endless number of things to consider which naturally leads to a harder time for us to be certain in situations. A possible solution then seems to be to go back to this child like snap judgement but not out of arrogance or stubborness, but instead out of the belief that we have considered enough things and come to a satisfactory conclusion. Have confidence that our decision is the right one because we know ourselves and are honest with ourselves, with no need to appease other people with our rationale or decision. After all, we are only human and if we can't be honest and believe in ourselves, then who can we believe? This also highlights what I believe is an important component of finding an internal sense of certainty, and that is to first find an internal sense of self. Otherwise, we are asking ourselves to meet the tall task of finding a sense of certainty amongst both the aforementioned external chaos in our lives as well as our internal chaos.
