Take a moment and reflect on some of your past ideals, maybe you wanted to be a millionaire by some age, or perhaps you wanted to be the CEO of some company. For some of the bigger goals, chances are that you didn't meet them, but this doesn't necessarily indicate some drastic failure on your part, does it? To set goals is a very human thing to do, and to fail to reach them is equally as human an experience. But instead of feeling remorse for falling short of these goals I think people often say / think something along the lines of "My experiences in my life since that point has changed my goals / ideals and now I realize that my current situation is what I truly wanted (perhaps before unbeknownst to me), or at least is something that I am extremely content with". Basically people seem to not harbour many negative feelings towards not reaching past goals, but instead think that their goals and ideals have changed rather than failed to have been met. I believe a lot of the time it's unclear whether this is some sort of coping mechanism to resolve cognitive dissonance and avoid feeling regret, or if it is truly the persons goals changing. My claim here is that nobody really knows the truth of the situation, yet you might feel that you do because you feel this internal sense of certainty. Let's explore this concept of this internal sense of certainty.

A simpler example would be, how can we tell the difference between pushing ourselves too hard and not pushing ourselves hard enough? Are we putting too much pressure on ourselves or are we taking the easy route and retreating at the slightest hint of danger / discomfort. Is it necessary that we need an external observer to tell us what the truth of the situation is? This seems unfeasible since the nature of experience is inherently subjective. Thus it seems foolish to claim that in the *general* case we must rely on others to make judgements regarding our personal situations.  

As we live our lives, we naturally grow as people as a result of our everchanging environments and new experiences. Yet at the same time
we find ourselves dealing with more and more serious decisions in our life, as well as the age-old struggle of finding ourselves. If we look beyond our lives, everything around us also often feels uncertain and it sometimes seems like the world itself is so uncertain. So how are we supposed to find an internal sense of certainty amidst the tumultuousness of our lives and the world? There are also a plethora of related questions we should explore such as, is uncertainty in our lives necessarily a bad thing? Is uncertainty a natural part of life? Is there such a thing as "true certainty"?

. . .

In my experience and conversations with people, it seems like this wasn't really a issue that occurred to us as kids. Obviously, the fact that we had less serious decisions plays a role, but what else could it suggest?  Our identities as kids are also lower-dimensional, so there is less internal complexity to us. Perhaps it means that as we become more complex people and see more of the world we realize there are more possibilities and perspectives than we initially thought, an endless number of things to consider which naturally leads to a harder time for us to be certain in situations. A possible solution then seems to be to go back to this child like snap judgement but not out of arrogance or stubborness, but instead out of the belief that we have considered enough things and come to a satisfactory conclusion. Have confidence that our decision is the right one because we know ourselves and are honest with ourselves, with no need to appease other people with our rationale or decision. After all, we are only human and if we can't be honest and believe in ourselves, then who can we believe? This also highlights what I believe is an important component of finding an internal sense of certainty, and that is to first find an internal sense of self. Otherwise, we are asking ourselves to meet the tall task of finding a sense of certainty amongst both the aforementioned external chaos in our lives as well as internal chaos.
