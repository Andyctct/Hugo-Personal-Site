At long last, the time has come and I have started to look for a job :(. Like any big life event, there's certainly been sadness, excitement, stress, fear, and many other emotions too. It's not an easy process and I'm still going through it (no job yet xd), but I am starting to get the hang of things a little bit, and I thought it would be cool to document the general process up to this point and eventually be able to give some advice on what worked for me. The format of this post will be a step by step "guide" similar to my [site creation guide](https://andyctct.netlify.app/blog/creating-this-website/). These steps do not necessarily need to be done in the order below, I chose what is a fairly typical order. This piece will be aimed at the beginner, skip steps as you like.

UPDATE 12/24/21: Landed a summer internship, reflections on that process at the end of this blog post in the MY ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCES section

UPDATE 9/11/22: Finally published this after having the full draft for so long, it's been so long that I've already finished my first internship period. Currently extended my summer internship into the fall semester so I'll be taking at least this semester off from school. Going to start looking for winter / summer positions soon. Market has changed quite a bit so we'll see how things go.

- Step 1: Resume. Resume. Resume. Almost definitely the most important part of the application process. Putting in the effort to make a resume that you're satisfied with (and preferably has been vetted) is an overwhelmingly worthwhile investment of your time. Chances are you're going to use this resume a considerable number of times (could very easily be in the hundreds), and every single time you use it, it determines whether or not you'll move along in the application process. If you're not sure about the quality of your resume or you suspect that your resume is causing you to miss out on opportunities, it never hurts to get your resume vetted, and there are tons of great resources for this including your school, online forums, or even just a few friends. Another perk of having a solid resume is that it will make it simple for you to update it down the line, but I would also note here that you might want to look into different resume formats as you acquire more and more experience. As for specific resume tips, there are an abundance of resources for that online so I would recommend looking at a few of them for some basic do's and dont's. Regarding resume templates, I think they're fine and would only caution that if you're going to use a template, keep your professional goal in mind and don't get too carried away.  

- Step 2: Once you have a resume that you are completely confident in, the next step is to apply. I believe that you shouldn't be too picky with your applications because you might miss out on a lot of opportunities, plus it's free to apply so no harm in doing so if you're on the fence about one. However, I've also heard contrary statistics and believe that you shouldn't apply to *too* many places especially if you're not very interested in them. This is because time can be scarce during applciation periods so if you're applying to too many places, then chances are that you're not putting much effort into the places you are applying to. This isn't so much a problem with some companies who only require a resume and some basic info for the initial application, but for others which may require cover letters or detailed responses to general questions, or give OAs (Online Assessments) right off the bat, then putting a little bit of effort into a lot of places may not work as well as concentrating your effort on the few places that really interest you. On the topic of cover letters specifically, it's a practice that isn't too common anymore in my experience (unless you were doing UofT PEY in my year, another drastic flaw of the co-op system), most places will give you the option to submit one, but I've seen very few that make it mandatory. If you need one, then once again there are an abundance of great resources taking you through how to build a cover letter.

- Step 2.5: A quick note about the job searching process in general. Like I said at the beginning, finding a job is stressful and difficult for the vast majority of people. So keeping a healthy mental state, and not burning yourself out is a challenging, but essential step. In many cases, even when it doesn't matter *when* you get the job, the process of looking for jobs and not getting them wears you down, an often unavoidable occurrence. Time mercilessly continues ticking, and everyone around you seems to be finding jobs as both internal and external pressure continuously mount. I think preventative methods such as mindset framing can be effective, but sometimes it isn't enough and it is a tall ask to convince someone not to feel stressed or disappointed about rejections or the lack of job opportunities. Thus, remedial solutions are important to think about when the time comes. Something I do is think about it in perspective, do I feel like things will turn out okay in the end? If not, is it only the job search that I'm worried about or are there other underlying factors? That's a personal introspective strategy but try things out and do whatever works for you, whether it's taking a deload week to refresh and reset, or talking to people about your job searching experiences so far, etc. At the end of the day, remember that even though a job may be greatly important to your life, your life is still much more than any job.  

- Step 3: Lastly, the interview stage. Congrats, you made it past the screenings and maybe a few OAs. Now comes my least favourite part. Interviewing. Note that I have only done virtual interviews at this point thanks to covid, and all my interviews were for computer science related positions, so I will be commenting exclusively from my experience in those. To start, everybody approaches interviews differently and handles interviews differently, and this applies to companies too. For specific interview advice, the internet as always, possesses an amazing variety of resources including websites such as glassdoor that can even give advice that is legally *too* specific (also there are many discord server gems). However, there are obviously still many recurring elements of interviews such as common behavioural questions or common general knowledge testing, and I definitely think it's worth preparing for these to some extent at least. Beyond that, doing as much research as you can to prepare for the *specific* interview you're doing is a valuable investment. For CS interviews specifically, obviously grinding leetcode or general technical problems can be effective and potentially valuable to you if you feel unconfident in that area or find yourself struggling on the techincal portions of interviews time and time again. If you're feeling discouraged, remember that even if you fail 100 interview stages, you only need to pass 1 to get a job. Also remember that an interview judges your worth to a company, but certainly not your worth as a person.  

- MY ANECODTAL EXPERIENCES: Finding a job was stressful, especially having to do it while balancing school. I started applying sometime in september which is relatively early, but definitely not as early as a lot of people do. In the beginning, I applied exclusively through my university's co-op portal which primarily consists of mid tier or relatively small companies. At the start, things were relatively relaxed, I didn't feel too much pressure and I was more or less just feeling things out by applying to a great deal of places. It wasn't too hard for me to secure interviews which I credit to my resume and really good GPA, I think my interview rate was somewhere around 20% which I thought was quite comfortable. However, that means there were still a lot of applications that I didn't hear back from / got rejected from through early screening assessments (I literally got rejected from a company after a PERSONALITY TEST). For the first few interviews, I didn't really know how to prepare so I was definitely a little bit all over the place, brushing up on a lot of programming languages, searching up company info, etc. Unsurprisingly, they didn't go too well, but I treated them like learning experiences because that's what they were. In the next interview or two, I felt a little bit better, but they were definitely still pretty shaky. Then, in this one interview I felt like I had done pretty well, and one of the interviewers told me that I was essentially guaranteed to make it through to the final round which was a take home assessment. I felt pretty good about my chances since the first interview went well, and I thought I did quite well on the take home assessment. Because of this, I took my foot off the gas a little bit, and didn't apply / interview nearly as much as I could have (BIG MISTAKE). Then, I was struck by the oh too common tale of a ghosting. Even with multiple follow-ups, I had not heard back regarding a decision from this company. Finally, one of the interviewers who I messsaged on linkedin (generally a no-no, but this guy was super nice and specifically told me to reach out to him regarding anything) told me that he thought I was all but assured the job. This obviously boosted morale, and I took my foot almost completely off the gas, turning down another set of interviews. You can probably see where I'm going with this, but in the end after another extended waiting period and another follow-up, the interviewer I was in contact with told me that there was a miscommunication and my chances of getting the position were actually very low. This was obviously an extremely frustrating experience, but thankfully it didn't have too many practical repercussions, and it also taught me a lesson that I should've known. ALWAYS WAIT ON A CONTRACT (2022 update: seems like even a contract nowadays isn't enough *cough Coinbase cough* ) before completely relaxing. By this point, the end of the semester was near which meant finals were starting, so I decided that I would turn down all my interview requests, focus on my finals, and then put all my effort into finding a job next semester. However, then I received an interview request from Amazon which I had done online assessments for recently. This was a company that I was really interested in, so I made an exception and started preparing for a final round interview with them. I spent somewhere around 10 days preparing which was certainly the longest that I had done for a company, and this was during final season too. In conclusion, I thought I did really poorly on the interview and was definitely disappointed with the missed opportunity, but I had made my peace and life goes on. Then, I got the news about a week later that I had secured the position and that's where I am now. Definitely excited about it, and definitely feel very fortunate, but I think that sense of disappointment was a valuable experience because I got to see how I would think about and feel / react to the rejection, and it gave me some valuable introspective insight. As for the near future, I'm still thinking about whether I want to apply for other jobs that would start after the summer internship or whether I should just go back to school. Regardless, I definitely want to learn a lot / contribute a lot to the internship this summer and I hope it'll be a rewarding period. I will likely update this as things progress.
