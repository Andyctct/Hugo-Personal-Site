Hi, I'm Andy and this is my blog. I am a newly graduated software engineer that specialized in computer science at the University of Toronto, although I am originally from Vancouver, British Columbia. In my free time, I like to exercise (mainly working out, running, and basketball), spend time with my friends, play games, watch anime, eat good food, and go down rabbit holes. I am currently trying to blog more so that I can force myself to think, and hopefully something cool will happen. I am also planning to make this website better and / or make other websites in the future.

Here are some people I find cool (in no particular order):

- [Kanye West](https://twitter.com/kanyewest)
- [Brandon Stanton](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/)
- [RDCWorld](https://www.youtube.com/user/rdcworld1)
