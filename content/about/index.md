Hi, I'm Andy and this is my blog. I am a software engineer that specialized in computer science at the University of Toronto, although I am originally from Vancouver, British Columbia. In my free time, I like to exercise (mainly working out, running, and basketball), spend time with my friends, watch anime, travel, eat good food, and go down rabbit holes. I am currently trying to blog more so that I can force myself to think, and hopefully something cool will happen.

Here are some random cool facts:
- I was a ranked immortal (~4000) player in Dota 2.
- I hit legend in hearthstone in 2 seasons.
- I scored 169 on the LSAT for fun. 
- I did the classic asia (mostly) solo travel backpacking trip for 3 months.
- My current 5k PR is 23:xx and 10k is 49:xx.
- I really like to snowboard. I also love to skate, but I don't know how to stop.
- I type relatively fast, 135-140 wpm.
- I am pretty good at treading water. 
- My favourite cities in the world are Vancouver and New York City.
- My favourite dog breed is pomeranian.
