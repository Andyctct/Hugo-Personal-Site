Hi, I'm Andy Wu and this is my first ever website. I am a third year student specializing in computer science currently at the University of Toronto although I am originally from Vancouver, British Columbia! Besides computer science, I also enjoy taking a variety of philosophy courses. I am looking for cs related work opportunities for this coming year, but open to other opportunities as well. In my free time, I like to exercise (mainly working out and basketball), play games, watch anime, eat good food, go down rabbit holes, and have great conversations with great people! I'm also going to try getting into a little bit of this blogging thing just so I can put some of my thoughts somewhere and hopefully it leads to some really interesting events in the future. I am also planning to make this website better and / or make other websites in the future.

Here are some of the people online that really inspire me (in no particular order): 

- [Kanye West](https://twitter.com/kanyewest)
- [Brandon Stanton](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/)
